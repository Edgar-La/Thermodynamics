## Code exercise 1.5
_The van der Waals constants for N<sub>2</sub> are a = 1.390 L<sup>2</sup>atm mol<sup>-2</sup> and b = 0.0391 Lmol<sup>-1</sup>. Consider 0.50 moles of N<sub>2</sub>(g) is in a vessel of volume 10.0 L. Assuming that the temperature is 300 K, compare the pressures predicted by the ideal gas equation and the van der Waals equation._
* _(a) What is the percentage difference in using the ideal gas equation instead of the van der Waals equation?_
* _(b) Keeping V = 10.0L, use Maple or Mathematica to __plot p versus N__ for N = 1 to 100, using the ideal gas and van der Waals equations. What do you notice about the difference between the pressure predicted by the two equations?_

## Code exercise 1.7
* _(a) Using the ideal gas equation, calculate the volume of one mole of gas at a temperature of 25Â°C and a pressure of 1 atm. This volume is called the Avogadro volume._
* _(b) The atmosphere of Venus is 98% CO<sub>2</sub>(g). The surface temperature is about 750 K and the pressure is about 90 atm. Using the ideal gas equation, calculate the volume of 1 mole of CO<sub>2</sub>(g) under these conditions (Avogadro volume on Venus)._
* _(c) Use Maple or Mathematica and the van der Waals equation to __obtain the Avogadro volume__ on Venus and compare it __(find the percentage difference)__ with the result obtained using the ideal gas equation._

## Code exercise 1.10
_Use Mathematica or Maple to __plot the van der Waals p-V curves__ for some of the gases listed in Table 1.1; see Appendix 1.2 for sample programs. In particular, compare the van der Waals curves for CO<sub>2</sub> and He with the ideal gas equation._

## Code exercise 1.12
_Using Table 1.1 and the relations (1.4.4) obtain the critical temperature T<sub>c</sub>, critical pressure P<sub>c</sub> and critical molar volume V<sub>mc</sub> for CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> . Write a Maple or Mathematica code to calculate the van der Waals constants __a__ and __b__ given T<sub>c</sub> , P<sub>c</sub> and V<sub>mc</sub> for any gas._
