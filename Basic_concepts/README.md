## Code exercise 1.5
_The van derWaals constants for N<sub>2</sub> are a = 1.390 L<sup>2</sup>atm mol<sup>-2</sup> and
b = 0.0391 Lmol<sup>-1</sup>. Consider 0.50 moles of N<sub>2</sub>(g) is in a vessel of
volume 10.0 L. Assuming that the temperature is 300 K, compare the
pressures predicted by the ideal gas equation and the van derWaals
equation._
* _(a) What is the percentage difference in using the ideal gas equation
instead of the van der Waals equation?_
* _(b) Keeping V = 10.0L, use Maple or Mathematica to plot p versus N
for N = 1 to 100, using the ideal gas and van der Waals equations. What
do you notice about the difference between the pressure predicted by the
two equations?_
